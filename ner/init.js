var article1 = "Shares in HSBC, BP and Vodafone \u2013 as well as other London-listed companies that generate a large proportion of their earnings outside the UK \u2013 are expected to gain ground in coming weeks if sterling weakens further.\n\nEquity strategists at asset management firms say they are rebalancing their UK portfolios, and issuing new stock recommendations, following the pound\u2019s continued weakness in the currency market \u2013 which earlier this week drove the sterling/dollar exchange rate below $1.50.\n\nSterling weakness tends to help investors with holdings in FTSE 100-listed companies as about 70 per cent of the index\u2019s earnings come from outside the UK, according to Goldman Sachs. It can also benefit smaller exporters in the FTSE 250, which are likely to receive a \u201Ccompetitive boost\u201D from a falling pound. Goldman\u2019s strategists are therefore encouraging investors to take long positions in UK companies with exposure to foreign markets and short-sell or avoid UK companies whose fortunes are tied more directly to the domestic economy.\n\nStocks on the bank\u2019s buy list include: Unilever and Diageo, the food and beverage groups that both trade on 15 times next year\u2019s earnings; AstraZeneca, trading on seven times 2010 earnings; Pearson, parent company of the Financial Times; Imperial Tobacco; and Royal Dutch Shell.\n\nStocks deemed unlikely to benefit from weaker sterling are Balfour Beatty, Carillion, British Land, Hammerson, Premier Foods, Green King, Ladbrokes and Marks & Spencer. As these companies\u2019 fortunes depend more on the UK economy, their share prices have been more closely correlated to movements in sterling.\n\nThe pound has fallen 29 per cent against the US dollar since hitting its last high in November 2007, and it is also down 27 per cent against the euro since its high in January 2007.\n\nFears that a hung parliament will lead to indecisive fiscal policy after the upcoming general election are now causing some analysts to forecast that sterling will remain in a slump for months. \u201CIt doesn\u2019t look that great for the pound at the moment,\u201D said Graham Spooner, equity adviser at The Share Centre.\n\nHowever, Jason Butler of Bloomsbury Financial Planning, advised private investors not to make short-term decisions.\n\n\u201COver the long term, there should be little impact on the returns one can expect \u2013 gains\nand losses between countries should even out over time,\u201D he said.";

var article2 = "Seven funds have pulled down the shutters after a wave of investors asked for their money back amid speculation about a possible drop in commercial property prices in reaction to the result of the June 23 referendum.\n\nThat in turn has raised concerns about the outlook for the broader financial system, given the risk of investors bailing out of other asset classes in a panic and of lenders to the sector such as banks suffering fresh balance sheet stress.\n\nHenderson Global Investors, part of Henderson Group, said on Wednesday it had temporarily suspended trading in its 3.9 billion pound UK Property PAIF and PAIF feeder funds due to exceptional liquidity pressures given uncertainty after the Brexit vote and the other suspensions.\n\nIt was followed within the hour by Columbia Threadneedle, part of the Ameriprise Group, which said it had suspended trading in its Threadneedle UK Property Fund.\n\nCanada Life said it had also suspended its Canlife Property and Canlife UK property funds, describing this as a deferral of requests to withdraw investments. The deferral can be for up to six months, enabling the funds to ensure property values reflect market conditions, it said in a statement.\n\nLate on Wednesday, Aberdeen Asset Management said withdrawals from its 3.2 billion pound UK Property Fund which it had received before 1100 GMT would face a 17 percent dilution levy, and that it would not fulfil later orders. It expected to re-open the fund at 1100 GMT on Thursday.\n\nThey joined rival funds managed by M&G Investments, Aviva Investors and Standard Life Investments which suspended trading on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nBlackRock Inc, the world\'s largest asset manager, on Friday told investors that it raised quarterly redemption charges on its 3.3 billion pounds BlackRock UK Property Fund to 5.75 percent, from 2 percent.\n\nOver half of the property fund sector is now on ice, and will remain so until managers raise enough cash to meet redemptions. To do that they need to sell properties, and as any homeowner knows, that is not a quick or painless procedure, said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nThese funds are therefore likely to be closed for weeks and months rather than simply a matter of days, he wrote in a note to clients before Aberdeen\'s announcement.\n\nBritain\'s Financial Ombudsman Service said it had begun to receive calls from retail investors worried about the closures and the potential hit to their savings. Although the decision to suspend redemptions was expected, the extent of the suspensions by the three funds so far is quite troubling, a spokeswoman said shortly before Wednesday\'s fund announcements.\n\nKeenan Vyas, Director in the Real Estate Advisory Group at Duff & Phelps in London, said the consequences could be profound.\n\nIf there continues to be a tremendous amount of redemption pressure in a short period of time this could result in a large number of sales transacting below book value and an eventual overall correction in property asset pricing across the UK market, said Vyas.\n\nBANKS\n\nDespite concern that the banking system - beset for years by toughening capital constraints and misconduct fines - could face a fresh hit from any write-down in commercial property, analysts were generally sanguine as total exposure was light.\n\nBanks haven\'t really played the asset class in the last five years - it\'s mostly been the shadow banking sector, said analysts at Bernstein in a note.\n\nBritish banks held about 90 billion pounds of the 183 billion pound commercial property loan market at the end of 2015, according to research by De Montfort University.\n\nRBS had the most exposure at 25 billion pounds or 5 percent of its assets, followed by Lloyds Banking Group with 18 billion (2 percent of assets) and Barclays at 11 billion (1 percent), according to Mediobanca Securities.\n\nOfficials said that banks are better placed than in 2008 to withstand falling real estate values, having reduced their overall exposure and increased capital reserves\n\nOne of the things the PRA (Prudential Regulation Authority)has done over the years is to ensure that the exposure of UK banks to commercial property has been kept quite manageable... This is not a big issue for UK banks, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday.\n\nConcerns that the UK upheaval could spread to Germany, Europe\'s other big real estate investment market, were also overdone, with no increase in demand to redeem there, said managers at Deka and Union Investment, among others.\n\nAs well as being better diversified, with UK property making up no more than 20 percent of most German funds\' portfolios, retail investors are also prevented from getting their investments back for 12 months.\n\nWhile UK funds still had daily dealing, the Financial Conduct Authority\'s Chief Executive said he was keen to look again at the inherent liquidity mismatch given property is tough to sell quickly.\n\nBritain\'s fund trade body reiterated on Wednesday that the funds need to review their suspensions every month. The manager and depositary are under a duty to ensure that the suspension is only allowed to continue as long as it is justified having regard to the interests of unit-holders, it said."

var article1 = "Shares in HSBC, BP and Vodafone \u2013 as well as other London-listed companies that generate a large proportion of their earnings outside the UK \u2013 are expected to gain ground in coming weeks if sterling weakens further.\n\nEquity strategists at asset management firms say they are rebalancing their UK portfolios, and issuing new stock recommendations, following the pound\u2019s continued weakness in the currency market \u2013 which earlier this week drove the sterling/dollar exchange rate below $1.50.\n\nSterling weakness tends to help investors with holdings in FTSE 100-listed companies as about 70 per cent of the index\u2019s earnings come from outside the UK, according to Goldman Sachs. It can also benefit smaller exporters in the FTSE 250, which are likely to receive a \u201Ccompetitive boost\u201D from a falling pound. Goldman\u2019s strategists are therefore encouraging investors to take long positions in UK companies with exposure to foreign markets and short-sell or avoid UK companies whose fortunes are tied more directly to the domestic economy.\n\nStocks on the bank\u2019s buy list include: Unilever and Diageo, the food and beverage groups that both trade on 15 times next year\u2019s earnings; AstraZeneca, trading on seven times 2010 earnings; Pearson, parent company of the Financial Times; Imperial Tobacco; and Royal Dutch Shell.\n\nStocks deemed unlikely to benefit from weaker sterling are Balfour Beatty, Carillion, British Land, Hammerson, Premier Foods, Green King, Ladbrokes and Marks & Spencer. As these companies\u2019 fortunes depend more on the UK economy, their share prices have been more closely correlated to movements in sterling.\n\nThe pound has fallen 29 per cent against the US dollar since hitting its last high in November 2007, and it is also down 27 per cent against the euro since its high in January 2007.\n\nFears that a hung parliament will lead to indecisive fiscal policy after the upcoming general election are now causing some analysts to forecast that sterling will remain in a slump for months. \u201CIt doesn\u2019t look that great for the pound at the moment,\u201D said Graham Spooner, equity adviser at The Share Centre.\n\nHowever, Jason Butler of Bloomsbury Financial Planning, advised private investors not to make short-term decisions.\n\n\u201COver the long term, there should be little impact on the returns one can expect \u2013 gains\nand losses between countries should even out over time,\u201D he said.";

var article2 = "Croda was in demand, outperforming a weak London market, after the specialist chemicals maker reassured on growth and cash returns.\n\nA capital-markets day this week focused on Croda\u2019s investment in new products, which it expects to help accelerate sales growth from next year.\n\n\u201CReturns are not expected to fall, despite rising capital expenditure, and we suggest incremental sales potential of \u00A3450m-500m from recent investments,\u201D said Morgan Stanley, the group\u2019s house broker.\n\nCroda also played down worries about its personal care business, which was the main cause of weaker than expected quarterly results last week. It blamed destocking but saw no sign that end markets had weakened, as key customers such as L\u2019Or\u00E9al and Beiersdorf were not cutting research spending.\n\n\u201CGiven Croda\u2019s strong balance sheet we see the potential for a \u00A3350m cash return over 2013/14 through a share buyback,\u201D said Goldman Sachs. It had a \u00A331.50 target price on the stock, which closed up 1.3 per cent to \u00A322.10.\n\nA number of earnings updates left the wider market directionless, with the FTSE 100 ending down 0.3 per cent, or 15.58 points, at 5,776.05.\n\nG4S dropped 3.1 per cent to 259.2p on news that Wolds prison in Yorkshire, which it has been running since 1992, would return to public sector management. The group, which in August had been criticised in an Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Prisons report, also failed to make the shortlist for five more prison contracts.\n\nBarclays analysts suspected a government strategy shift that would be negative for the services sector. \u201CIt effectively signals a smaller revenue pot skewed towards lower-margin work for future prison outsourcing,\u201D said the broker.\n\nInterserve slipped 5.5 per cent to 368.2p on news that all three prisons it was bidding for would be kept under public management. Serco, which was in line to overtake G4S as Britain\u2019s biggest prison contractor, lost 1.9 per cent to 558p.\n\nEngineering services companies dropped on a profit warning from Balfour Beatty, which warned of a sharp deterioration in UK construction demand.\n\n\u201CFundamentally, the larger projects where the group could differentiate itself are not coming through,\u201D said Investec Securities. \u201CAs a result, 50 per cent of the order book is now regional work, and we believe the risk is now all on the downside for this business.\u201D\n\nBalfour dived 18.3 per cent to 250.1p, WS Atkins was down 5.6 per cent to 677.5p, Carillion lost 4.3 per cent to 296.7p and Kier Group was 2.2 per cent lower at \u00A312.05.\n\nENRC was weakest among the miners, losing 3.4 per cent to 294.6p after it cut spending and cancelled an iron ore project in Brazil. Production figures were in line but net debt increased by $500m to $3.9bn over the quarter, raising fears of a cash call to bolster the balance sheet.\n\nPennon fell 2.2 per cent to 677.5p after Goldman Sachs downgraded it to \u201Csell\u201D. Investors were overvaluing earnings growth from energy-from-waste projects and ignoring the potential increased volatility in earnings, Goldman argued.\n\nNomura Securities also turned negative on the water sector, citing regulatory risk and stretched valuations. United Utilities edged 0.2 per cent lower at 659p and Severn Trent was down 1.3 per cent at \u00A315.17.\n\nRumours of takeover interest in the water utilities looked \u201Cplausible\u201D but had already been reflected in share prices, with United and Severn both pricing in a one-fifth probability of a bid within the next six months, Nomura said.\n\nDialight, the richly valued LED lighting maker, dropped 5.7 per cent to \u00A311.15 after cautioning of a contract delay for its division that installs warning lights on skyscrapers. Investors were also disappointed by a lack of upgrades for Dialight\u2019s industrial division, its main source of growth.\n\nSoftware maker Fidessa bounced from a two-year low, up 2.2 per cent to \u00A313.35, amid talk that a stock overhang had been cleared. The sketchiest of takeover rumours helped Speedy Hire, the tool rental group, advance 3.8 per cent to 34.3p.\n\nPace, also the recent subject of bid speculation, took on 2.8 per cent to 193.4p ahead of a trading update due Wednesday. Plans by AT&T to expand its high-speed broadband network were positive for Pace, given AT&T was its largest customer last year accounting for up to a fifth of revenues, said Espirito Santo."
